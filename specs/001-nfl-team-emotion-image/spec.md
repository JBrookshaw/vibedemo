# Feature Specification: NFL team emotion-based image generator

**Feature Branch**: `001-nfl-team-emotion-image`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create an application that allows selecting an NFL team based on logo. Then based on the chosen NFL team search Twitter for posts about that team and its players and based on the emotions of the posts and topics being discussed generate an image that reflects this."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Select team and generate image (Priority: P1)

As a sports fan, I want to pick an NFL team by clicking its logo so the app can analyze recent public Twitter posts about the team and generate an image that reflects the prevailing emotions and topics, so I can quickly understand fan sentiment visually.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value: connecting team selection to an immediate visual summary of fan sentiment.

**Independent Test**: Manually select a team, trigger the analysis, and confirm an image is produced that references the team's identity and reflects extracted emotions/topics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app is open, **When** the user selects a team logo and clicks "Generate", **Then** the system shows a progress indicator and then displays a generated image plus a short dashboard summarizing detected emotions and top topics.
2. **Given** the user selects another team, **When** they generate again, **Then** the image and summary update to reflect the new team's current Twitter sentiment.

### User Story 2 - View emotion and topic breakdown (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to see the emotions detected (e.g., joy, anger, sadness) and top topics mentioned so I can understand why the image looks the way it does.

**Why this priority**: Improves transparency and trust in the generated image.

**Independent Test**: After generating an image, inspect the emotion breakdown and topic list and verify they match the example tweet samples shown.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an image is displayed, **When** the user expands the "Details" panel, **Then** the UI lists detected emotions with percentages and top 3 topics with sample tweet excerpts.

---

### User Story 3 - Refresh and history (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to refresh the analysis to see more current sentiment and view a short history of recent generated images for this team so I can track sentiment over time.

**Why this priority**: Adds value for repeat users and enables trend observation.

**Independent Test**: Generate images at two different times and confirm the history shows both images with timestamps; refresh updates results when new tweets exist.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a previously generated image exists, **When** the user opens the team page, **Then** they see up to the last 5 generated images with timestamps and a "Refresh" button to re-run analysis.

### Edge Cases

- No recent tweets found for the selected team: display a friendly message and allow user to broaden the time window or search manually.
- Rate limits from Twitter API: surface an informative error and fall back to cached results if available.
- Offensive or abusive tweets dominate the feed: still report emotions/topics but hide or redact explicit content in examples; flag content as sensitive.
- Player name ambiguity (same name different people): use context (team handle, hashtags) to prioritize tweets relevant to the team.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Users MUST be able to select an NFL team by clicking its logo from a team gallery.
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept an explicit "Generate" action to begin analysis and image generation.
- **FR-003**: System MUST fetch recent public posts from Twitter relevant to the selected team and its players; the default timeframe is the last 24 hours unless the user chooses a broader window.
- **FR-004**: System MUST perform emotion analysis on fetched posts and extract top topics/keywords.
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate an image that reflects the aggregated emotions and prominent topics and visually references the selected team (colors, logo placement or name), while avoiding trademark misuse guidance (see assumptions).
- **FR-006**: System MUST display an emotion breakdown (e.g., percentages of joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise) and a ranked list of top topics with sample tweet excerpts.
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle Twitter API rate limits and provide clear error messaging and fallbacks (cached data or retry suggestion).
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to refresh the analysis and view a short history (up to 5) of previously generated images with timestamps.
- **FR-009**: System MUST redact or mask offensive or explicit content when showing tweet excerpts and mark when content was redacted.
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist minimal metadata for generated images and analysis (team id, timestamp, summary statistics) for the history view.

*Resolved items:*

- **FR-011**: System MUST search public posts from the last 24 hours by default; the UI must allow users to broaden the window to 7 days or 30 days.
- **FR-012**: System MUST prioritize (weight) tweets from verified accounts when computing the primary aggregated sentiment; verification status must be visible in sample tweets and the UI may allow switching to an unweighted or verified-only view.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Team**: Represents an NFL team. Key attributes: team id, name, official colors, logo reference.
- **TweetSample**: Represents a fetched tweet excerpt used for topic/emotion analysis. Key attributes: tweet id, text (redacted if sensitive), created_at, author_handle, relevance_score.
- **AnalysisResult**: Represents aggregated analysis for a generation run. Key attributes: analysis_id, team_id, timestamp, emotion_breakdown (map emotion -> percentage), top_topics (ranked list), image_reference.
- **GeneratedImageRecord**: Minimal persisted metadata for history: image_id, analysis_id, team_id, created_at, summary_text.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can generate an image for a selected team and see results within 30 seconds in 95% of attempts (measured end-to-end for production-like requests).
- **SC-002**: Emotion analysis accuracy: for a small human-reviewed sample (n=100), automated emotion labels match human labels for primary emotion in >= 80% of cases.
- **SC-003**: 90% of users in a usability test rate the generated image as "representative" or "somewhat representative" of fan sentiment for that team.
- **SC-004**: When no tweets exist in the selected timeframe, system displays a clear user message and provides options to broaden the search in 100% of occurrences.

## Assumptions

- Twitter provides access to public posts matching queries for teams and players (API access and reasonable rate limits are available). If Twitter access is unavailable, an alternative public data source or cached data will be used.
- Using team logos and names is permitted for non-commercial internal use; trademark and licensing considerations will be handled separately (legal review) before public release.
- Default timeframe for fetching posts is the last 24 hours unless the user chooses to broaden or narrow the window (options: 24h, 7d, 30d).
- By default, the system will weight tweets from verified accounts more heavily when computing primary sentiment; verification status will be visible in sample tweets. A UI control may allow switching to an unweighted or verified-only view.
- Emotion taxonomy will use a standard set: joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise, neutral. Topic extraction will return top N keywords (default N=5).
- Image generation will be stylistic and abstract (no photorealistic deepfakes of real people) to reduce legal/ethical risk.

## Constraints & Privacy

- Only public tweets are used and displayed; private or protected accounts are excluded.
- When displaying tweet excerpts, redact personally-identifying metadata beyond author handle and created_at; mask any contact info found in text.
- The system must comply with the chosen data provider's terms and privacy policies and with applicable laws regarding use of public social media data.

## Open Questions / Resolved

1. Timeframe for searching posts — resolved: default 24 hours (user can select 24h/7d/30d).
2. Prioritize verified accounts — resolved: yes, verified tweets are weighted higher for primary sentiment; verification status is shown in samples and a UI control can switch views.

## Test Cases / Acceptance Criteria

- Generate workflow (happy path): Select team -> Click Generate -> Wait (progress) -> See image + emotion breakdown + top topics -> Click Details -> See sample tweets (redacted) matching listed topics.
- No tweets: Select team with no recent tweets -> System shows "No recent public tweets found for this team. Broaden timeframe?" and allows user to pick 24h/7d/30d.
- Rate limit: Force a simulated rate-limit response from Twitter API -> System shows informative message and displays last cached result if available.
- Offensive content: Include tweets flagged as explicit in sample set -> System redacts sensitive content and marks it as redacted in sample.

## Implementation Notes (do not include implementation details in spec)

- This spec intentionally focuses on user value and behavior. Implementation choices (APIs, ML models, frameworks, hosting) should be decided during planning.
