# Specification Quality Checklist: NFL team emotion-based image generator

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
 - [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
 - [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification
 - [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
 - [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Validation Notes (2025-10-22)

Summary: I validated the spec against the checklist. Several items passed. Remaining issues are listed below with quotes and recommended fixes.

1) Implementation details: addressed / passed

	- I replaced explicit references to "Twitter's developer terms" with "the chosen data provider's terms" and moved provider-specific notes into Assumptions so the spec remains focused on behavior and dependencies rather than implementation.

2) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers: resolved

	- Both clarification markers were resolved per user choices: default timeframe set to 24h and verified accounts prioritized (weighted) for primary sentiment. The spec was updated accordingly.

3) Scope bounding: partial â€” needs small acceptance tie-in

	- The remaining scope item is minor: explicitly reference the history/persistence acceptance scenario next to FR-010 to close the loop.

4) Acceptance criteria coverage: addressed

	- I added acceptance coverage references earlier (User Story 3 includes history with timestamps). To be explicit, link FR-010 to that scenario if you want the spec text updated.

Next steps: If you want, I can (a) add a one-line acceptance scenario next to FR-010 that references the history behavior, and (b) re-run the checklist validation. Otherwise I will mark validation completed and produce the final report.
